# -Predicting-Bitcoin-Price-Movements
This project delves into the dynamic realm of cryptocurrency price prediction by
employing a hybrid approach merging Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and
Support Vector Machines (SVM) and other machine learning algorithms. The study
focuses on Bitcoin, a leading digital currency, leveraging Python-based tools and
libraries for preprocessing and modeling. The preprocessing stage involves
comprehensive data normalization and feature engineering to enhance model
performance. The ANN architecture is tailored to capture intricate nonlinear
patterns within historical Bitcoin price data, while SVM complements this by
discerning complex relationships for classification tasks. Through rigorous
evaluation and comparison of these models, this research aims to ascertain their
efficacy in predicting Bitcoin price movements, contributing valuable insights to
the challenging domain of cryptocurrency forecasting.
Additionally, the dataset undergoes rigorous cleaning procedures to handle
missing values, outliers, and potential noise, bolstering the robustness of
subsequent analyses. Feature engineering plays a pivotal role, involving the
creation of lagged variables, rolling averages, and technical indicators tailored to
cryptocurrency markets. This tailored feature set seeks to encapsulate intricate
temporal patterns and dependencies within Bitcoin price data, empowering the
models to extract meaningful insights.
